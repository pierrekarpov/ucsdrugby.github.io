                                <p><img src="./img/gallery_images/lb_tournament/lb16.jpg"/>Saturday was another rugby day for the Tritons and one of their last as they wind down their season. The day began early when the team met up to load the vans in preparation for a long drive to Santa Barbara Community College. A quick burrito stop along the way got the Tritons fueled and ready for battle.
<br/><br/>
Upon arrival in early afternoon Sandman, first time van driver, finally found his way into a parking space and the Tritons took to the blistering hot field. Despite the loss that day the team was able to walk away with a vision for the future. Strengths and weaknesses were taken note of and the Tritons plan for improvement moving forward. The next game, and the last of the season, should be an exciting one to say the least so be sure to stop by Warren Field for another Triton rugby day.</p>

                                <h1>Men’s Rugby at Long Beach <small>Sunday, March 8, 2015</small></h1>
                                <p><img src="./img/gallery_images/lb_tournament/lb14.jpg"/>Following a defeat to CSU Fullerton, UC San Diego Men’s Rugby team looked upon to redeem itself against the Long Beach State. Despite the early efforts by the UC San Diego to score a try, Long Beach State overpowered the Tritons by power running to the goal line. The extra points only strengthened their lead.
<br/><br/>
Long Beach State’s lead was established early. A couple of missed tackles by UC San Diego players only favored Long Beach State. Despite beautiful passes by Captains Steven McCloskey and Isaias Bustos, and defense by Judah Word, UC San Diego fell to Long Beach State at their home field.
<br/><br/>
Only notable injury of the game was sustained by Brandon Ong, a fly half for UC San Diego, who injured his shoulder stopping a run by an opposing player. Despite the tough lost to a rival, UC San Diego Men’s Rugby team looks to end its losing streak and get redemption against Santa Barbara CC on March 14th.</p>

                                <h1>UCLA Tournament January 17th-18th <small>Saturday, January 17, 2015</small></h1>
                                <p><img src="./img/gallery_images/uc_tournament/uc8.JPG"/>The UC San Diego Men’s Rugby Team took a road trip to UCLA this weekend for the 10th Annual Dennis Storer Classic - “All Cal” Tournament. The Tritons played three matches on Saturday and one on Sunday. All matches were two 20 minute halves. Our first match was the second of the morning against host UCLA. A hard fought first half between both teams’ A-sides led to three Bruin tries to our one. The Triton back-line showed some flare early as center Andrew Dries scored the first try of the match off of a pass from Co-Captain Isaias Bustos. 12 substitutions were made at half time to get many newer players experience against a strong Bruin team. Late in the second half, wing Manny Martinez picks up his first try of the tournament. Final score: UCLA 31, UCSD 10.
<br/><br/>
After a short break, the Tritons took on UC Riverside. The Tritons showed strength in their drives down the field, but came up short on two critical goal line situations. Jacob Buck showed his sideline speed scoring the only try of the match, but it was not enough to stop three big breaks from Riverside. Final score: Riverside 19, UCSD 7.
<br/><br/>
<img src="./img/gallery_images/uc_tournament/uc13.JPG"/>In our last match on Saturday, the Tritons took on UCSC. Due to inexperience and fatigue on the Triton side, the Banana Slugs found holes in the Triton’s defensive line which led to four breakaway scores. Final score: UCSC 28, UCSD 0.
<br/><br/>
After a good night’s rest, the Tritons came out ready for their Sunday match versus UC Davis. Although UC San Diego was outsized by the Aggies, they put up a strong fight. Defensively, the Tritons did not let up big plays, and offensively, the Tritons drove down the field with consistency. In the second half, Manny Martinez scored on a chip kick from flyhalf Brandon Ong. On the previous play, hooker Khalil Kanbar had a strong forward ball which set up a mismatch on the wide side of the field. The score was Martinez’s second of the tournament and 6th of the preseason. In the end, the Aggies proved they were a dominant team as the match ended 36-5.
<br/><br/>
On a team with roughly half of its players being rookies, the Tritons are eager to continue learning and working on their mistakes in the next two weeks. Their next game is the first of the regular season at USD on January 30th at 8:00pm.</p>

                                <h1>Team history</h1>
                                <p><img src="./img/gallery_images/social/social2.jpg"/>UCSD Rugby has a long and colorful history. Founded in 1966, the club is one of the oldest sports on campus.  The general attitude of the 1960's and early '70's fostered a perfect source of recruits for the counter culture of rugby. These early years of the "rebel sport" gave way to serious, competitive play in the mid 1970's. In 1975, UCSD captured the Collegiate Championship of the Santa Barbara Tournament, the largest rugby fixture in the West. During this period, UCSD rugby alumnus Peter Sertic took over the head-coaching job and solidified the team with active recruiting, and routinely fielded two sides.<br/>
The 1984-85 season brought a coaching change; Tom Butler built upon the foundation laid by Coach Sertic. In 1987 UCSD captured the first of three successive Southern California College division rugby championships. Butler also began the tradition of touring every year.<br/>
The 1989-90 season was the first time the Tritons played in the University Division (DI), making rugby and water polo the only UCSD sports to compete in league play at the Division I level. That season, the Tritons had a respectable league record, and swept the University of San Diego and San Diego State to win the "Kings of the City" title.   In 1992, the Tritons toured overseas for the first time, playing in the Bahamas.  Two UCSD players received the honor of playing for the Bahamian national team. The team returned to the Caribbean the following year, touring Jamaica in 1993.<br/>
Coach Butler retired following the 1992-93 season. Former assistant coach Mark Stenson took over, and along with Eric Takeuchi sought to continue UCSD's winning ways. Along the way Paul Reynolds and Tim O’Hara joined to help coach the forwards and backs, respectively. The Tritons were the Division II runners-up in 1996, and in 1997 won the Division II Southern California championship.<br/>
The 1998 team captured the first ever Division II National Championship held by USA Rugby, beating the University of Oregon in the finals in Albany, NY. In the three games in three days format, the Tritons’ superior fitness and skills showed as they outscored their opponents 86-13.<br/>
In 1999, former captain Troy Meyer joined the coaching staff.  The Tritons again dominated league play, and earned a shot to defend their title at the National Championship in Cincinnati.  UCSD won it all for a second straight season, coming from behind to beat Chico State in the finals, 21-18.  The 1999 squad also took the team’s first-ever European tour, traveling to Wales (the site of the Rugby World Cup later that year) during Spring Break.<br/>
The Tritons opened the new millennium by moving up to compete in Division I.  They finished a very respectful 5-3 in their first year, narrowly missing a playoff birth.  In 2003, Stenson and Takeuchi stepped aside, and O’Hara and Reynolds took over the coaching duties.  Former player Dave Thomas joined the coaching staff in 2005 after returning to San Diego, and the Tritons continued to compete in the top level of collegiate rugby.<br/>
O’Hara and Reynolds stepped down from coaching after the 2007 season.  Triton alum Brian Kennedy took over heading into the 2008 campaign.  Takeuchi came out of retirement to coach the backs, and Thomas stayed on to run the forwards.  After the 2008 season, SCRFU realigned the Collegiate Division.  Division One was reduced from ten teams to five, based on 2008 standings.  UCSD was among the five teams relegated, and returned to Division Two competition in 2009.  After that season, SCRFU again realligned, and UCSD was placed in Division Three. The Tritons finished in second place, their only loss by a three-point margin to league champion CSU Fullerton.<br/>
Based on their strong 2010 performance, the Tritons moved back to Division Two for the 2011 season.  As USA Rugby continued to realign the divisions, UCSD moved into the new 1AA Division for the 2013 season.  Heading into 2014, UCSD is the newly formed Gold Coast Conference of Intercollegiate Rugby, a Socal D1AA conference.  The conference is new, but UCSD faces old foes, including Claremont, Long Beach, Fullerton, and local rival USD.</p>
